## 1.1.1 (2026-04-17)

### Fixed
- **Compose Quick Start boots cleanly.** `deploy/compose/.env.example`
  now includes `FAUCET_DEV=1` with a comment — local-trial mode that
  relaxes hardening (allows plain HTTP + wildcard CORS) so the stack
  works against http://localhost:8080. Without this the container
  crashed on first boot with the hardening check at
  [apps/server/src/hardening.ts:137-145](apps/server/src/hardening.ts#L137-L145).
  Fixes [#39](https://github.com/PanoramicRum/nimiq-simple-faucet/issues/39).

### Added
- CI `compose-smoke` job that boots the compose faucet service from the
  local-trial `.env.example` and asserts `/healthz` returns 200. Would
  have caught #39 pre-release.
- `docker-compose.yml` now explicitly threads
  `FAUCET_DEV: ${FAUCET_DEV:-0}` on the faucet service environment, so
  `.env` is the single place to flip it on (default stays `0` — a raw
  `docker-compose.yml` still boots in production-hardening mode).

### Changed
- Helm chart bumped to `1.1.1` / `appVersion: 1.1.1`.
- Flutter SDK bumped to `1.1.1`.

## 1.1.0 (2026-04-17)

### Added
- **`/readyz` endpoint.** `/healthz` stays pure liveness; `/readyz`
  reflects whether the signer driver is ready (for WASM: consensus
  established; for RPC: always ready). Probes, Helm, and the admin
  dashboard can now distinguish "process alive, driver syncing"
  from "process dead". Returns `200 {ready:true}` or
  `503 {ready:false, reason:"driver_not_ready"}` with `Retry-After: 10`.
- **`CurrencyDriver.readyPromise` + `isReady()`** — optional members on
  the `@faucet/core` driver interface. The server uses them to gate
  driver-dependent routes without blocking startup.
- **`DriverReadinessBanner`** in the admin dashboard — surfaces
  "Signer driver syncing" while `/readyz` returns 503, so operators
  can see the state instead of getting a connection-refused error
  or a confusing 503 from the claims table.
- **`START.md`** — `Choose your adventure` menu extracted from README
  so the README reads cleanly and the menu lives in one canonical
  place. README now points AI agents at `START.md` verbatim.

### Changed
- **Fastify now listens immediately at boot, regardless of driver
  state.** Driver-dependent routes (`POST /v1/claim`, admin account /
  overview / send) return `503 Retry-After: 10` until the driver
  signals ready; every other route (`/healthz`, `/readyz`,
  `/admin/*`, `/v1/config`, `/v1/challenge`, UIs) serves from t=0.
  Before 1.1, the WASM driver blocked `buildApp()` until consensus,
  rendering `/admin` and `/healthz` unreachable for the entire sync
  window (or forever if consensus never established). Fixes
  [#36](https://github.com/PanoramicRum/nimiq-simple-faucet/issues/36).
- Helm chart bumped to `1.1.0` / `appVersion: 1.1.0`.
- Flutter SDK bumped to `1.1.0`.
- ROADMAP §1.1.2 marked as shipped; new §1.1.2a (dependency-chain
  `/readyz`), §1.1.2b (Helm probes migration), and §1.1.2c
  (upstream `@nimiq/core` refresh, tracking #35) added.

### Known
- The bundled WASM light client cannot reach TestAlbatross consensus
  against `@nimiq/core@2.2.2` — upstream-blocked. Tracked in
  [#35](https://github.com/PanoramicRum/nimiq-simple-faucet/issues/35)
  and ROADMAP §1.1.2c. Use the RPC signer driver against a local
  `core-rs-albatross` node (`docker compose --profile local-node up -d`)
  for a working end-to-end setup.

## 1.0.2 (2026-04-17)

### Fixed
- **Quick Start now boots.** The README `docker run` block was missing
  `FAUCET_SIGNER_DRIVER=wasm` + `FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY`; the default signer
  is `rpc`, which needs `FAUCET_RPC_URL` + `FAUCET_WALLET_ADDRESS`, so
  the literal copy-paste crashed at startup for 100% of users. Quick
  Start now recommends `docker compose --profile local-node up -d`
  (works end-to-end today); the image-only `docker run` path is kept
  as a smoke-test with honest caveats pointing at #35 and #36. Fixes
  [#37](https://github.com/PanoramicRum/nimiq-simple-faucet/issues/37).

### Changed
- `deploy/compose/.env.example` default `FAUCET_SIGNER_DRIVER` flipped
  from `wasm` (upstream-blocked — see #35) to `rpc`, matching the
  compose README's Option A/B walkthrough.
- `AGENTS.md` quests **[1] Quick demo** and **[2] Docker container
  trial** now point at the compose path instead of a never-worked
  `docker run` shape.
- Helm chart bumped to `1.0.2` / `appVersion: 1.0.2`.
- Flutter SDK bumped to `1.0.2`.

## 1.0.1 (2026-04-17)

### Fixed
- **Published Docker image now starts.** `better-sqlite3`'s native
  binding is produced in the prune stage before being copied to the
  runtime, fixing a startup crash that affected 100% of "Quick start"
  users. Fixes [#33](https://github.com/PanoramicRum/nimiq-simple-faucet/issues/33).
- **Compose stack no longer advertises an unsupported Postgres backend
  by default.** `DATABASE_URL` is unset; the server falls back to
  SQLite at `/data/faucet.db`. The `postgres` and `redis` services are
  kept in docker-compose.yml behind a new `postgres` profile for when
  server-side support lands (tracked in ROADMAP §1.3.4). Fixes
  [#34](https://github.com/PanoramicRum/nimiq-simple-faucet/issues/34).

### Changed
- Clearer error message when a Postgres `DATABASE_URL` is supplied
  today — points at ROADMAP and the SQLite default path.
- Helm chart values.yaml and examples/values-prod.yaml document
  `postgresql.enabled=true` / `redis.enabled=true` as **not yet
  functional** on 1.0.x; defaults remain `enabled: false`.
- Helm chart bumped to `1.0.1` / `appVersion: 1.0.1`.
- Flutter SDK bumped to `1.0.1`.

### Added
- CI smoke-test step that boots the just-built Docker image and asserts
  `/healthz` returns 200 — would have caught #33 pre-release.
- ROADMAP §1.3.4 "Server-side Postgres storage backend" with concrete
  scope and an estimated effort.
